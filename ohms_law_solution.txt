#Write a simple Python program that calculates Voltage (V) using Ohm’s Law.
#Solution:

#This lines of code calculates the Voltage:

#Ohm's Law Formula:
#V = I * R
#Where:
#V is Voltage (in volts)
#I is Current (in amperes)
#R is Resistance (in ohms)

print("This is a simple Python program that calculates Voltage (V) using Ohm’s Law:")
I = float(input("Enter the value for Current 'in A': "))
R = float(input("Enter the value for Resistance 'in ohms': "))
V = I * R
print("The Voltage is: " + str(V) +"volts")
